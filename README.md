## Autoloss_ltr

1. This project addresses the challenge of manually designing loss functions by combining AutoML technology with LTR models. By using an automatic loss function generation framework, it is possible to automatically generate optimal loss functions and adapt to different datasets.

2. The effectiveness of the automatically generated loss functions was evaluated through comparative experiments between models using traditionally designed loss functions and models using automatically generated loss functions.

3. This research is applicable to real-world problems in the fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and Learning to Rank (LTR), contributing to the development of more efficient and effective models.
